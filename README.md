# BridgeLabz-Training
Repository Overview

This repository documents my progress throughout the BridgeLabz Fellowship Program, capturing daily learning, coding practice, and hands-on implementation across multiple technical tracks. 

Learning Tracks :

Core Java : Java fundamentals, syntax, control flow, problem-solving, and algorithm practice (LeetCode).

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) : OOP principles, system design fundamentals, application architecture, and advanced Java concepts.

The repository is continuously updated to reflect ongoing learning and skill development.
